# Balancing settings
# ============================================================
#
# Important:
#   The script still writes all selected windows/events to the output .npz files.
#   However, for balancing good and bad runs, events with no selected hits after
#   channel filtering do NOT count.
#
# In other words:
#   n_windows = total windows in the original sparse file, or in one virtual
#               run slice if an aggregate file is split by evt_run
#   n_balance = number of unique events that have at least one selected hit after
#               applying CHANNEL_START <= channel < CHANNEL_END
#
# Good/bad balancing uses n_balance, not n_windows.
# This prevents empty windows from dominating the class balance.
#
# Event balance is based on unique:
#
#   (evt_run, evt_subrun, evt_num)
#
# So if one event appears in multiple windows, it is counted once.
#
# Aggregate input files:
#   If one .npz contains multiple evt_run values, this script splits it into
#   virtual per-run inputs during selection and output writing. This prevents a
#   combined file such as tpc_data_bad_runs.npz from being treated as one huge
#   unsplittable run.


# If None:
#   use all selected training runs.
#
# If an integer:
#   cap the training set at approximately this many unique non-empty selected
#   events, while keeping whole runs together.
#
# Because runs are never split, the final training balance count may be below
# this cap. If the minimum training selection already exceeds this cap, the
# script raises an error instead of slicing through a run.
MAX_TRAIN_EVENT_N = None
# MAX_TRAIN_EVENT_N = 100000


# If None:
#   use the original split behavior, but balance using unique non-empty selected
#   events:
#     - select all bad runs for test
#     - randomly select enough good runs to approximately match the bad
#       unique non-empty selected event count
#     - put everything else into training
#
# If an integer:
#   first reserve good runs for training until at least this many unique
#   non-empty selected events are available for training.
#
#   Then the test set is built only from the remaining good runs and the bad
#   runs.
#
#   In this mode, if there are not enough remaining good unique non-empty events
#   to match all bad unique non-empty events, or not enough bad unique non-empty
#   events to match all remaining good unique non-empty events, the script uses
#   the lower available balance count as the target for each test class.
#
# Note:
#   Run selection is whole-run based, so final selected counts can be a bit
#   above the target if the last selected run crosses the target. No run is
#   split between train and test.

# If True:
#   original channels 9600, 9601, ..., 9649 become 0, 1, ..., 49

# If False:
#   original channel numbers are kept unchanged
#   and n_channels is kept from the original files.
